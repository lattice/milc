# Makefile for testing code by comparing test output with sample output
# For pure_gauge

#------------------------------------------------------------
# Examples for vanilla tests:

#    make -f Make_test "ARCH=vanilla" test
# or, for a specific project or projects
#    make -f Make_test "ARCH=vanilla" "PROJS=su3_rmd" test

# For tests on the SP, do the same, but use "ARCH=sp_mpi" with
# the appropriate MP_PROCS environment variable set.

# For tests on other platforms, first edit the file ../Make_test_template
# to select the appropriate LAUNCH and ARCH.  Then run
# commands as above, but without the command line "ARCH=..." definition.

# Results are in the files out.test.diff.*
