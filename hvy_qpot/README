	This directory contains code for the measurement of time-like
Wilson loops with APE-smeared links for the space-like segments, giving
better overlap for the extraction of the heavy quark potential.

The program always measures planar, time-like Wilson loops, and depending
on the input parameter "off_axis_flag" also off-axis time-like loops with
the space like parts along the directions (1,1,0), (2,1,0) and (1,1,1)
plus others related by the lattice symmetry.

The computation of the Wilson loops is done by first performing a gauge
transformation to axial gauge, after the desired APE smearing of space-like
links is accomplished.

Some simple glueball operators are also measured from the original and then
the smeared links, namely the 3 orientation of spatial plaquettes summed
over each time slice. The O++, 2++ and 1+- glueball correaltion functions
can then be constructed in the analysis stage.

Before compiling this code, the libraries must be compiled.  See the
"libraries" directory.

Use different Makefiles for different machines:
        For a generic workstation, use "Make_vanilla".
        For the Intel machine or Intel simulator, use "Make_intel".
        For the Ncube machine, use "Make_ncube

To make the code:
  Edit "Make_XXXX" to get the library directories, etc. set right
  make -f Make_XXXX su3_hqp >& make.log &
Here "Make_XXXX" is the Makefile
For the Ncube machine, use:
  make -f Make_ncube nodes=NN su3_hqp >& make.log &
        here "NN" is the number of nodes you want to use.

To run the code on your workstation (using "com_vanilla.c")
   su3_hqp < in.sample > out.sample

To run the code on the Intel machine:
  getcube -tNN
  newserver > out.sample
  load su3_hqp
  waitcube < in.sample
  relcube
where NN is the number of nodes you want to use

To run the code on the Intel machine simulator:
  bsim
  getcube -tNN
  load su3_hqp
  start
      enter the input by hand
      ctrl-d to stop program
      ctrl-c to awaken simulator
  quit
where NN is the number of nodes you want to use

To run the code on the Ncube machine:
   xnc -d XX su3_hqp < in.sample > out.sample
or
   xnc -d XX -N YY su3_hqp < in.sample > out.sample
where XX is the dimension of the cube and YY is the starting node.
(Number of nodes = 2^XX)

"in.sample" is a sample input file
